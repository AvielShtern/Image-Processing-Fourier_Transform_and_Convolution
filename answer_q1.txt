In naive fast forward of speech (change_rate) there is a side effect: pitch becomes higher.
This happens because we raise the frequencies.

On the other hand, in fast forward using fourier (change sample) the pitch is not raised higher.
However, because the signal is not stationary, we lose the meaning of time and the frequencies from different times mix.
